I have worked with many different teams within Microsoft including Defender, Intune, and Windows. My strengths are the ability to work independently or cooperatively as needed to accomplish project goals. Driven to broaden required abilities and take on new challenges.</p></td>

              <td><p>I have been in a release support role for ten plus years at Microsoft with teams such as Windows defender, Windows Intune, and then Windows Server which merged with WSD where I owned providing Out of Band build support for teams needing sustained patching while also supporting the WSD mission. I am innovative and performance driven, with excellent problem-solving abilities. I seem to thrive in chaos with a passion for bringing order to it â€“ which may explain my attraction to release management in some form or another for the last 10 years.</p></td>
